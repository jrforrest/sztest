# sztest

Just trying out Sunzi.  This runs off of my fork of Sunzi since the mainline has some weird behavior I don't like.

I started out with a basic user creation system and then ported some nginx and unicorn scripts over from an ansible config I had lying around.

I think I'll abandon the effort here and go back to ansible because Sunzi makes some things really akward (facts/dynamic variables for one.)
